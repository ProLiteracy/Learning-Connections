README: "Datasets" Folder

Background: This folder allows us to draw from the O*NET 21.2 Database without directly pulling data via API requests.

Caveat: The downside of this is that these data are "snapshots" and require manual updates, rather than automatically updating via APIs.

You can find deeper explanations for the variables at the O*NET Center using the following URL:
